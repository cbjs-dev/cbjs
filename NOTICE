This code includes entire new packages and features, along with several improvements on various fronts.
This software contains code derived from the work of Couchbase, Inc. (https://www.couchbase.com/).

Below is a non-exhaustive list of the changes that have been made.

TypeScript :
A lot of effort has been put to introduce type safety for KV operations: it offers typed input and output for all operations (including sub-document operation) but also path autocompletion for sub-document operations.
Some modifications have been made to offer type guard to callbacks and several function overloads have been written to reflect the actual behaviour of the function.

HTTP Client :
A HTTP client has been created in order to support operations that are not offered by the native implementation.
It also support lightweight environment where loading 10+ MB of binary is not optimal.
The initial reason of its creation is deployment automation.

Tests :
All the tests have been fixed, improved, reworked, completed and migrated to vitest.
They run against the actual database, not mocks.
Also, many fixtures are made available for those who use vitest and want to setup their integration test accordingly.
